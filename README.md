# Battlecode Match Runner
This is a simple python script for Battlecode that lets you run multiple local bots against each other, and keep track of their wins for use in iteration and testing.

To use this, edit the script and fill the players list with your local bot names, and edit the scaffold_directory string to be the full path name of your battlecode scaffold directory (or ./ if you copy this script into the scaffold directory directly).

I have only tested this script on my computer running Windows, so this may not work out of the box on other systems.
